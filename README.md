Keep your apps where you left them!

What is PersistentWindows? A poorly named utility that persists window positions and size when the monitor display count/resolution adjusts and restores back to itâ€™s previous settings.

For those of you with multi-monitors running on a mixture of DisplayPort and any other connection, you can run this tool and not have to worry about re-arranging when all is back to normal.

The tool is crude and brute force for now but will improve.
